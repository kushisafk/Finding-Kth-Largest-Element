  2. User chooses input method (manual, file-based, or random generation).
  3. User enters or loads array of integers.
  4. User specifies the value of K.
  5. Validator checks validity of the input and K.
  6. User selects algorithmic strategy or accepts default.
  7. KthLargestService calls the selected strategy to compute the Kth largest element.
  8. Strategy implementation processes the data and returns result.
  9. Result is displayed to the user with additional information if enabled.
  10. User may repeat the process with different inputs or strategies.
